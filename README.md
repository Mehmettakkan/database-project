# The main purpose of the Supply Chain Management project

I designed a project to create a MySql-based database and perform operations on this database using SQL queries. This project is based on supply chain management and store management. First of all, a database was created containing the information of customers, suppliers, stores and employees. Later, tables were added to this database to track orders, products, warehouses and order transactions.

The project performs various operations on the database using SQL queries. For example, it performs operations such as processing customer orders, updating product stocks, and changing employee information. In addition, various SQL queries are used to create reports in the database, providing access to information such as analysis of customer expenditures and product sales statistics.

The project aims to implement topics such as database design, relational database concepts and the use of SQL queries. In this way, it is aimed to improve database management skills in areas such as supply chain management and store management.

# Skills I Gained with the Project

1. In this project, basic concepts about relational database design and establishing relationships between tables were learned.
   
2. By applying normalization rules, its importance in organizing and storing data tables was understood.
   
3. It was understood how database integrity is ensured by defining relationships through primary keys and external keys.
   
4. Learned how to model more complex structures of database schemas using Entity-Relationship Model (EER).
   
5. During the project, an applied approach to real-world scenarios regarding database design and management was developed.
   
6. As a result of this project, basic strategies and practical knowledge were gained to increase the performance, reliability and data integrity of database systems.
   
7. Practical experience was gained on important operations such as database management processes, backup, restore and performance improvement.
   
8. Query performance was increased and the database system was made more efficient.
